# 1) STATA: Visualization of Regression Results and Correlation Structures (Heatmaps)
# • Demonstrates the ability to create professional-quality graphs for academic publications.
# • Includes code to visualize regression results and display correlation structures through heatmaps.
# • The STATA code runs based on the auxiliary file stata_data.

# 2) Python - Mutual_Fund_Flows.py: SQL-Based Data Retrieval and Custom Variable Generation
# • Utilizes SQL queries to download financial data and demonstrates expertise in generating
# new variables, such as mutual fund flows, dummies for whether a fund is an index fund, and estimates for the date of fund-mergers.
# • Highlights the ability to construct specialized functions (e.g., aggregating flows at the
# mutual-fund level) and handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring scalability and robustness in data analysis.
# • The Python code runs while an internet connection is secured, and the folder python_data includes the auxiliary files.

# 3) Python - python_sample_graphs.py: Generation of graphs
# • Utilizes statsmodels, seaborn, matplotlib, and mpl_toolkits packages.
# • Demonstrates the ability to quickly and clearly construct graphs commonly used in economics, 
#   including time series analysis, regression diagnostics, and distribution visualizations.
